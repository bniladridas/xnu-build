# XNU Build

[![Build Status](https://github.com/bniladridas/xnu-build/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bniladridas/xnu-build/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A comprehensive build system for compiling Apple's XNU kernel on macOS, featuring automated environment detection, source management, and compilation fixes for common issues.

## ⚠️ Critical Disclaimers

### System Kernel Replacement Not Possible

Modern macOS uses System Integrity Protection (SIP) and kernel code signing that prevent replacing the system kernel. Attempting to boot custom kernels on production systems can cause system instability or permanent damage.

**Recommendation**

Use this build system for educational and virtual machine testing only. Never attempt kernel replacement on real hardware.

**Example**

In this code, attempting to load a custom kernel on a production system:

```bash
# DANGEROUS - Do not run on real hardware
sudo kextload /path/to/custom/kernel.kext
```

This can cause system crashes, data loss, or require complete OS reinstallation. Instead, use virtual machines:

```bash
# SAFE - Test in QEMU virtual machine
./scripts/test-vm.sh
```

## Requirements

### Missing Build Dependencies

Building XNU requires specific tools and versions. Using incompatible or missing dependencies can result in compilation failures or incorrect kernel binaries.

**Recommendation**

Ensure all required dependencies are installed and at compatible versions before building.

**Example**

In this build attempt, missing Xcode Command Line Tools causes failure:

```bash
$ ./scripts/build-all.sh
ERROR: Xcode Command Line Tools not found
```

Install the required tools:

```bash
# Install Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# Verify installation
xcodebuild -version
```

**Required Dependencies**
- **macOS**: 11.0+ (Big Sur or later)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: Latest version
- **Git**: For source management
- **Python 3**: For build scripts

**Optional for VM Testing**
- **QEMU**: 6.0+ (for kernel testing)
- **UTM**: For native Apple Silicon support
- **VirtualBox**: For traditional x86_64 testing

## XNU Kernel Primer

XNU is Apple's open-source kernel that powers macOS, iOS, and other Darwin-based systems. It combines three major components:

### Mach Microkernel

The foundation layer providing:
- **Memory Management**: Virtual memory, paging, and protection
- **IPC (Inter-Process Communication)**: Message passing between tasks
- **Scheduling**: Thread and task scheduling
- **Low-level Services**: Timers, interrupts, and device drivers

### BSD Layer

Provides POSIX compatibility:
- **System Calls**: Interface between user space and kernel
- **Process Management**: fork, exec, process lifecycle
- **File Systems**: HFS+, APFS, and network file systems
- **Networking**: TCP/IP stack and socket interfaces
- **Security**: User permissions and access control

### I/O Kit

Device driver framework:
- **Driver Matching**: Automatic driver loading for hardware
- **Power Management**: Device power states and transitions
- **Hot Plugging**: Dynamic device attachment/removal
- **User-Space Drivers**: Support for complex device drivers

### Build Process

The build system compiles these components into a unified kernel binary:

1. **Source Integration**: Combines Mach, BSD, and I/O Kit sources
2. **Cross-Compilation**: Uses macOS SDK for kernel compilation
3. **Linking**: Creates Mach-O executable with proper load commands
4. **Compression**: Generates kernelcache for efficient loading

## Build Output

- `output/arm64/kernel`: Uncompressed Mach-O kernel binary
- `output/arm64/kernelcache`: Gzip-compressed kernel for faster booting
- `output/arm64/kernel.dSYM/`: Debug symbols for kernel debugging

## Testing

### Unsafe Kernel Testing Practices

Testing custom kernels on production systems or real hardware can cause system crashes, data corruption, or permanent damage due to kernel panics or incompatible drivers.

**Recommendation**

Always test kernels in virtual machines with proper isolation. Use QEMU or UTM for safe kernel experimentation.

**Example**

Dangerous testing on real hardware:

```bash
# DANGEROUS - Can crash system permanently
sudo reboot  # After installing custom kernel
```

Safe testing in virtual machine:

```bash
# SAFE - Isolated testing environment
./scripts/test-vm.sh
qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt -kernel output/arm64/kernel -nographic
```

## Troubleshooting

## Comparisons to Other XNU Build Methods

While there are several ways to build XNU, this build system provides specific advantages:

### Manual Build Scripts

Traditional approach using Apple's documentation:
- **Pros**: Direct control, follows official methods
- **Cons**: Error-prone, requires deep knowledge, no automation

This system automates the manual process while maintaining compatibility.

### Xcode Projects

Using Xcode for kernel development:
- **Pros**: Integrated IDE, debugging support
- **Cons**: Limited to userland, complex setup for kernel

This system focuses on command-line kernel builds for CI/CD and automation.

### Third-Party Tools

Other build tools and scripts:
- **Pros**: May have additional features
- **Cons**: Often outdated, not maintained, security concerns

This system stays current with Apple's latest sources and security practices.

## Contributing

Any change to build scripts or behavior must come with tests and documentation.

Patches that break builds or reduce reliability will be rejected.
